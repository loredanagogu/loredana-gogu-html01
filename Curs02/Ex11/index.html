    Berlin, Germanyâ€™s capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of the city's turbulent 20th-century history include
    its Holocaust memorial and the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during the Cold War, its 18th-century
    Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of reunification. The city's also known for its art scene and modern landmarks
    like the gold-colored, swoop-roofed Berliner Philharmonie, built in 1963.

    The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species
    in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the
    family.[4] A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human
    contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat
    breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a
    strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night
    vision and sense of smell are well developed.
