  <h2>Twitter</h2>
  <h3>Details</h3>

  <p>
    Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages
    known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like, and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read them.
    Users access Twitter through its website interface or its mobile-device application software ("app"), though the
    service could also be accessed via SMS before April 2020.[13] The service is provided by Twitter, Inc., a
    corporation based in San Francisco, California, and has more than 25 offices around the world.[14] Tweets were
    originally restricted to 140 characters, but the limit was doubled to 280 for non-CJK languages in November
    2017.[15] Audio and video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds for most accounts.

  <p>
    Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and launched in July of
    that year. By 2012, more than 100 million users posted 340 million tweets a day,[16] and the service handled an
    average of 1.6 billion search queries per day.[17][18][19] In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and
    has been described as "the SMS of the Internet".[20] As of Q1 2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active
    users.[10] Twitter is a some-to-many microblogging service, given that the vast majority of tweets are written by a
    small minority of users.[

  <h2>Facebook</h2>

  <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>
    Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew
    McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes from the face book directories often given to American
    university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North
    American universities and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years old. As of 2020, Facebook claimed 2.8 billion monthly
    active users,[2] and ranked seventh in global internet usage.[7] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the
    2010s.[

  <p>
    Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and
    smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post
    text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their "friend" or, with
    different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each other with Facebook Messenger,
    join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and pages they
    follow.
