  <h2>Despre Google</h2>

  <p>Google was founded in September 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford
    University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly-listed shares and control 56% of the
    stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in
    2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.. Google is Alphabet's largest
    subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's Internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed
    CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai
    also became the CEO of Alphabet.[12]</p>

  <p>The company's rapid growth since incorporation has included products, acquisitions, and partnerships beyond
    Google's core search engine, (Google Search). It offers services designed for work and productivity (Google Docs,
    Google Sheets, and Google Slides), email (Gmail), scheduling and time management (Google Calendar), cloud storage
    (Google Drive), instant messaging and video chat (Google Duo, Google Chat, and Google Meet), language translation
    (Google Translate), mapping and navigation (Google Maps, Waze, Google Earth, and Street View), podcast hosting
    (Google Podcasts), video sharing (YouTube), blog publishing (Blogger), note-taking (Google Keep and Jamboard), and
    photo organizing and editing (Google Photos). The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating
    system, the Google Chrome web browser, and Chrome OS (a lightweight, proprietary operating system based on the FOSS
    Chromium OS operating system). Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with
    major electronics manufacturers in the production of its Google Nexus devices, and it released multiple hardware
    products in 2016, including the Google Pixel line of smartphones, Google Home smart speaker, Google Wifi mesh
    wireless router. Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet carrier (Google Fiber and Google Fi).

  <h2>Twitter</h2>

  <p>Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages
    known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like, and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read them.
    Users access Twitter through its website interface or its mobile-device application software ("app"), though the
    service could also be accessed via SMS before April 2020.[13] The service is provided by Twitter, Inc., a
    corporation based in San Francisco, California, and has more than 25 offices around the world.[14] Tweets were
    originally restricted to 140 characters, but the limit was doubled to 280 for non-CJK languages in November
    2017.[15] Audio and video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds for most accounts.
  </p>

  <p>Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and launched in July of
    that year. By 2012, more than 100 million users posted 340 million tweets a day,[16] and the service handled an
    average of 1.6 billion search queries per day.[17][18][19] In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited websites and
    has been described as "the SMS of the Internet".[20] As of Q1 2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active
    users.[10] Twitter is a some-to-many microblogging service, given that the vast majority of tweets are written by a
    small minority of users.
  </p>


  <h2>Facebook</h2>

  <p>Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew
    McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes from the face book directories often given to American
    university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North
    American universities and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years old. As of 2020, Facebook claimed 2.8 billion monthly
    active users,[2] and ranked seventh in global internet usage.[7] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the
    2010s.[</p>

  <p>
    Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and
    smartphones. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post
    text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their "friend" or, with
    different privacy settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each other with Facebook Messenger,
    join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and pages they
    follow.
  </p>

  <h2>Bing</h2>

  <p>
    Bing, Microsoft's replacement for Live Search, was unveiled by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on May 28, 2009, at the
    All Things Digital conference in San Diego, California, for release on June 3, 2009.[2] Notable new features at the
    time included the listing of search suggestions while queries are entered and a list of related searches (called
    "Explore pane") based on semantic technology from Powerset,[3] which Microsoft had acquired in 2008.
  </p>

  <p>In October 2011, Microsoft stated that they were working on new back-end search infrastructure with the goal of
    delivering faster and slightly more relevant search results for users. Known as "Tiger", the new index-serving
    technology had been incorporated into Bing globally since August that year.[8] In May 2012, Microsoft announced
    another redesign of its search engine that includes "Sidebar", a social feature that searches users' social networks
    for information relevant to the search query.</p>
